# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
<<<<<<< HEAD

## Overview
### Pewlett Hackard is a large corporation that will be seeing many of its employees reaching retirement age in the very near future. This will leave a large gap in qualified staff to continue functioning at full capacity. The ask is to determine to the potential impact on the nearly half a million person workforce and identify those who are eligible for the mentorship program in an effort to reduce the gap that will be left by the anticipated retirements. 

## Results
### -	As many as 72,458 employees qualify for retirement in the near future. This is represents over 14% of the workforce of Pewlet Hackard.
### -	Senior Engineers and Senior Staff account for the majority of those eligible for retirement (70%). A much smaller portion include engineers, staff, technique leaders, assistant engineers, and only 2 managers. 
### -	Looking toward the future 3126 employees have been identified as potentials for the mentorship program to help ease the transition.
### -	Despite over 3,000 current employees identified for mentorship potential there remains a significant gap of almost 70,000 employees. 


## Summary
### As the “silver tsunami” hits there will be a gap that is beyond the available employees to fill. With only 3216 employees identified as potentials for the mentorship program, that leaves approximately 70,000 remaining openings. If all remains the same in the company structure the entire 72,000 employees will have to be hired (to back-fill those mentorship positions as well). This will account for approximately 14% of their entire workforce needing to be hired. Early and aggressive recruitment are needed as they are not the only company to be hit with the “silver tsunami”. Additionally, they should look at their structure and ensure they are using lean techniques and evaluate if all positions need to be replaced as is or if changes can be made.
